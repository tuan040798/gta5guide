From button sequences to secret phone numbers and PC console commands, we've got a complete list of all the GTA 5 cheats for you",
    "data": "Play the stocks in Grand Theft Auto 5 and get maximum profit from Lester's Assassination Missions\n Playing the stock market is slightly intimidating, and can be risky for those unprepared, or out of the loop. Lester's Assassination Missions, on the other hand, can provide huge amounts of cash money after the GTA 5 story missions are done, with little to no risk. You won't be judged for wanting more, or who you chose to get it.\n As far as playing the GTA 5 stock market goes, you're going to need to keep an eye on the two in-game markets: The LCN and the BAWSAQ, and watch how prices are affected throughout the game. The basics are simple though: Buy low, sell high. \n The two stock markets in Grand Theft Auto 5 are more or less like you would find in real life. To make money investing in the markets, you'll need to invest when markets are low and sell your stocks when markets are high. It seems easy enough, but trying to predict what markets will do and how they will behave can be a rather tricky endeavour. \n There are some times that you can invest your money in particular stocks - with all three characters - to make some you hefty dollars, such as Lester's Assassination Missions, but for the most part, it's all a matter of watching the markets and keeping an eye on the stocks you have purchased to make sure you dump them at the right time. \n You can use your cellphone or laptops to check the markets for immediate in-game prices. You can also check the Rockstar Social Network for stock behaviour on the BAWSAQ, although it seems to be slightly behind the actually in-game prices."

    "data": "If you want to show off your skills as a ruthless driver, then the GTA 5 stock car races are the perfect place to do it. To get started on them, you need to complete the Mr. Philips mission with Trevor, after which a marker will appear in the Grand Senora Desert near his main airstrip. What follows is a series of GTA 5 races, where you'll unlock a set of stock cars with subsequent pole positions, and your ultimate prize is the GTA 5 Cheval Marshall monster truck. To see all the rewards you can unlock and where to claim them, follow our GTA 5 stock car races guide and put the pedal to the metal. \n\nYou'll need to find a suitable ride to enter the first race - a muscle or sports car should do it. Win races to unlock the following vehicles, in order:\n\n1: Burger Shot Stallion\n2: Redwood Gauntlet\n3: Pi√üwasser Dominator\n4: Sprunk Buffalo\n5: Cheval Marshall\nOnce unlocked, you can access the four stock cars from any of the characters' personal garages.\n\nYou can also collect the Cheval Marshall from Trevor's airstrip hanger in Grand Senora Desert, with a set of 25 different flag liveries to choose from. Now get out there and cause some monster truck mayhem!"

    "data": "Dodo Seaplane\nThe GTA 5 Dodo seaplane is a very handy vehicle to have access to, as it combines the ability to fly (unlike its now extinct namesake) with being able to land anywhere on water, making rivers and lakes your new runways. If you want to add this to your transport options in GTA 5, then you'll first need to complete the Nervous Ron mission with Trevor. Once that's done, the GTA 5 Dodo seaplane will appear as a Random Event at a set location, and we've got all the details on how to find it in our guide below.\n\nThe Random Event is found in the sea cove east of Ron Alternatives Wind Farm. You'll need to approach on a boat or sea faring vehicle to trigger the event - jet skis are available from the beach a little further down the coast to the south.\n\nOnce the marker appears, head into the cove and shoot the gunmen in the boats before hopping into the Dodo.\n\nAs you leave the area two more boats of gunmen will attack, but you can simply fly away and leave them behind. Once completed, the Dodo seaplane will spawn in the following two locations:\n\nAt the dock on the small Vinewood Hills lake.\nAt the dock to the north of the Alamo Sea.\nThere's also the option to buy the Dodo from the Elitas Travel website for a cool $500,000 once you've completed the Random Event."

    "summary": "If you‚Äôre also looking to use mods to improve your GTA 5 gaming experience but are having trouble deciding which ones to pick, then we're here to help. In this article, we have shortlisted five of the best mods that you can use for GTA 5 in 2020.",
    "data": "TOP 5 GTA 5 MODS\n\n1. Turn Los Santos into a photorealistic gangster's paradise :\n\nYou can't talk about GTA mods without paying respects to all the coders out there tirelessly attempting to make Los Santos look as breathtakingly beautiful as possible. There's literally hundreds of graphics enhancement mods available for GTA 5, but NaturalVision Remastered, which only came out a few months ago, is the current champion when it comes to raw ‚Äúphwoar‚Äù power.\nOffering 4K resolutions and a complete overhaul of Rockstar's original aesthetic, the mod was designed ‚Äúto make GTA 5 look visually similar to Southern California in real life.‚Äù To be honest, the results look better than real life SoCal ever could. NaturalVision pushes Los Santos out of the realm of uncanny valley and into a level of graphical fidelity that redefines the very definition of what it means to be photorealistic.\n\nBecome Iron Man :\n\n‚ÄúI am Iron Man‚Äù said Iron Man in Iron Man, and you can say it too if you install this forever popular mod on to your GTA 5 save. True to its word, the mod hooks you up with a fully operational Iron Man suit, complete with boost thrusters, repulsor beams, and that oh so satisfying ‚Äúeeeeeyooooop‚Äù blaster sound that any Marvel fan will be familiar with.\nYou can even customise it with different versions of the suit, including the beefy Hulkbuster armour that swaps agility for raw strength. Tony Stark would be proud.\n\nReturn to Vice City:\n\nGTA: Vice City holds a fond place in many players' hearts, but even with the updated versions released by Rockstar it's still looking rather dated in 2020. Not so in Vice Cry: Remastered, a port of the popular Vice Cry mod for Vice City, which gives the fictional Miami a beautiful makeover complete with rippling waters and shimmering sunsets.\nAs well as proper mapped roads, car generators, and working traffic lights, there are new missions dropping which make this so much more than just a cosmetic makeover. It's definitely worth popping on a Hawaiian shirt and heading back to the '80s to check this one out.\n\nPretend you're playing Blade Runner in a neon-soaked Los Santos\n\nBlade Runner 2049 has been and gone, and we're still a ways off from CD Projekt Red's open world Cyberpunk 2077, but you can at least enjoy Grand Theft Auto 2013 by dressing it up in a neon aesthetic with this visual mod.\nIntensity ENB dials up the contrast between colours to 11, lending this ethereal, miasmic quality to Los Santos that's drenched in atmosphere, especially when it also happens to be drenched in rainfall. The game's lighting effects have been intensified too, meaning you'll often feel like you're in a J.J. Abrams movie just as much as a cyberpunk flick.\n\nCreate an underwater megalopolis by triggering a tsunami\n\nAll the best cities are underwater. Think about it; Atlantis, Rapture, that one from The Phantom Menace‚Ä¶ okay, maybe not all the best cities, but a fair few of them at least. So what's stopping you from seeing whether Los Santos fares any better once submerged beneath ten thousands tonnes of H2O?\nSeriously, you can try it now with this mod, which brings in a Tsunami to unleash waves of salty sea water upon the town, where only the highest skyscrapers can be seen above the surface. It's an in-game natural disaster that has to be seen to be believed."
